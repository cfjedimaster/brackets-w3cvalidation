Issues/Updates
=====
[4/21/2013] Remove links in explanation that just point to the 'add' function. Make links open in new window.
[11/12/2012] Update code to properly insert the content over the status bar. Also made it resizable.  
[9/26/2012] Fixes some display issues.

Currently it is performing a HTTP request on file edits. Not sure I like that.

As with the other extensions I built, it is heavily based on the work of [Jonathan Rowny](http://www.jonathanrowny.com/).
